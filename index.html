                <h2>New NFT experience in the CollectiveWEB Metaverse space</h2>
                <p>Art needs an audience!<br><br>
                    While guests were gathering at the hall of the WOW summit — the biggest event of the uprising industries and technologies, such as NFTs, GameFi, Blockchain and Metaverse, the CollectiveWEB team was busy in the pre-run of the summit's virtual exhibition.<br><br>
                    
                    The virtual exhibition appeared as a gracefully rendered 3D gallery space, located in the meta Dubai, allowing everyone around the world to dive into the latest and the most hyped form of art tech — the NFTs. The virtual gallery exhibited 38 carefully selected works (ready to be explored, discussed and purchased) created by 28 artists (including newly discovered and the Internet favourites).<br><br>
                    
                    Every corner of the meta venue was polished, the meta Burj Khalifa was looking as magnifique as the original, the masterpieces were installed and the video avatars of our precious worldwide guests started to gather around the art.<br><br>
                    
                    4 days in metaverse equals 4 days in real life, and the WOW virtual exhibition, as well as the WOW summit was coming to an end. More than 1400 collectors, investors and enthusiasts have joined the CollectiveWEB metaverse to explore the WOW summit NFT gallery.</p>
